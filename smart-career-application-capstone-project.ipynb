Introduction\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant (SCAA) is an AI-powered agent designed to help job seekers quickly understand their strengths, improve their resumes, and receive career recommendations. This project uses the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini LLM models, and tool integrations to perform resume analysis and provide real-time job market insights.\n\nSCAA automates key stages of the job application process, including skill extraction, job role suggestions, resume improvement tips, salary research, and cover letter generation.\n\n📘 2. Project Objective\n\nMany job seekers struggle to understand:\n\nWhat skills their resume highlights\n\nWhich job roles match their profile\n\nHow to improve their resume\n\nWhat skills are in demand today\n\nCurrent salary trends\n\nThis project solves these problems with one intelligent agent that analyzes resumes and provides actionable insights within seconds.\n\n📘 3. What This Notebook Demonstrates (Capstone Requirements)\n\nThis notebook implements five ADK concepts (more than the minimum three required):\n\n✔ 1. LLM-powered agent using Gemini\n✔ 2. Built-in ADK Tool: google_search\n✔ 3. Custom Tool: Python skill extractor\n✔ 4. File processing: Automated PDF resume extraction\n✔ 5. Observability: run_debug() call with agent trace\n\nThese features combined form a full, real-world career assistant system.\n\n📘 4. System Workflow Overview\n\nLoad Resume (PDF) from Kaggle input\n\nExtract text using pdfplumber\n\nExtract skills using custom Python tool\n\nSend resume + skills to ADK agent\n\nAgent performs:\n\nResume summary\n\nJob role recommendations\n\nResume improvements\n\ngoogle_search tool call for job market trends\n\nCover letter generation\n\nThis creates a complete AI-driven career analysis pipeline.\n\n📘 5. Tools & Technologies Used\n\nGoogle ADK (Agent Development Kit)\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Lite\n\ngoogle_search Tool\n\nCustom Python Skill Extractor\n\nPDF text extraction using pdfplumber\n\nInMemoryRunner for debugging & agent flow\n\nKaggle Notebook environment\n\n📘 6. Key Features Implemented\n✔ Resume PDF Upload & Extraction\n\nThe system loads and processes a PDF file directly from the Kaggle dataset.\n\n✔ Skill Extraction Tool\n\nA custom Python tool extracts relevant technical skills from the resume text.\n\n✔ Intelligent Agent Reasoning\n\nThe ADK agent analyzes skills and provides smart recommendations.\n\n✔ Google Search Integration\n\nAgent fetches real-time market insights:\n\nSalary trends\n\nIn-demand skills\n\nJob descriptions\n\n✔ Cover Letter Generation\n\nThe agent creates a personalized, professional cover letter.\n\n📘 7. Results\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant produces:\n\nExtracted skills\n\nThree-point resume summary\n\nRecommended job roles\n\nResume improvement tips\n\nMarket skill demand\n\nSalary insights\n\nAuto-generated cover letter\n\nThese results significantly reduce the time required for job preparation.\n\n📘 8. Conclusion\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant (SCAA) demonstrates how a single ADK agent can combine local tools, LLM intelligence, and real-time search to build a practical, high-impact application. This project successfully automates career guidance and highlights the power of intelligent agents for real-world productivity.\n\n📘 9. Future Improvements\n\nAdd multi-agent system (Resume Agent + Salary Agent + Job Match Agent)\n\nIntroduce memory to personalize recommendations over time\n\nDeploy as a web application\n\nAdd PDF section detection (Education, Experience, etc.)\n\nJob–Resume Match Scoring","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries

The experience with brand identity updates and marketing materials aligns perfectly with typical graphic design responsibilities.\n*   **Web Designer:** The resume explicitly mentions experience in \"web design\" and updating landing pages to align with brand identity. This, combined with graphic design skills, makes Quarantino a strong candidate for web designer roles.\n*   **Marketing Designer/Visual Designer:** Quarantino's experience leading projects to improve marketing and website experience, coupled with skills in graphic design and photography, would be valuable in a role focused on creating visual assets for marketing campaigns.\n\n**Resume Improvement Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Quantify Achievements with Metrics:** While Quarantino mentions leading projects, adding specific, measurable results would be much more impactful. For example, instead of \"Led numerous graphic design projects to improve the company’s marketing and website experience,\" try \"Led redesign of marketing materials, resulting in a 15% increase in engagement\" or \"Updated landing page graphics, contributing to a 10% uplift in conversion rates.\"\n2.  **Detail Project Management and Video Editing Skills:** The resume lists \"Project Management\" and \"Video Editing\" as skills but doesn't elaborate on them within the work experience. Providing specific examples of projects managed or types of videos edited would showcase the depth of these abilities.\n3.  **Strengthen the \"Profile\" Section:** The current profile is a good start but could be more dynamic. It should be tailored to the specific job, highlighting 2-3 key strengths and career aspirations relevant to the role. For instance, it could mention a passion for visual storytelling or a specific design aesthetic.\n\n**Skills in Demand for 2025:**\nThe skills Quarantino Esposito has are relevant for 2025, but the market is evolving rapidly. Based on the search results, here's a breakdown of in-demand skills:\n\n*   **Motion Graphics and Video Editing:** This is consistently highlighted as a highly sought-after skill for 2025 across creative roles, including graphic designers. The demand for video content across digital platforms is significant.\n*   **UI/UX Design:** Understanding user experience and interface design is crucial for creating user-friendly and engaging digital products, including websites.\n*   **AI in Design:** Proficiency with AI-powered design tools is becoming increasingly important for efficiency, automation, and generating creative ideas.\n*   **Web Development Fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):** While not a primary focus for a graphic designer, a basic understanding of coding can enhance a web designer's versatility and collaboration.\n*   **Digital Marketing Skills:** For roles bridging design and marketing, understanding SEO, content strategy, and social media marketing is beneficial.\n\nQuarantino's current skills in graphic design, photography, and project management are foundational. To enhance marketability for 2025, focusing on motion graphics, video editing, and potentially exploring UI/UX principles or AI-assisted design tools would be advantageous.\n\n=== FINAL ANSWER ===\n\nparts=[Part(\n  text=\"\"\"Here's an analysis of Quarantino Esposito's resume:\n\n**Candidate Summary:**\n\n*   A graphic designer with over three years of experience in project leadership and diverse design areas like marketing and web design.\n*   Possesses a Master of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and a Bachelor of Arts, demonstrating a strong educational background.\n*   Experienced in graphic design, photography, video editing, and project management, with a focus on improving marketing and website experiences.\n\n**Suitable Job Roles:**\n\n*   **Graphic Designer:** This is the most direct fit, given Quarantino's title, experience, and skills.
