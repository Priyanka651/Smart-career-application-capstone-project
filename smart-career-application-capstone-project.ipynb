Introduction\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant (SCAA) is an AI-powered agent designed to help job seekers quickly understand their strengths, improve their resumes, and receive career recommendations. This project uses the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini LLM models, and tool integrations to perform resume analysis and provide real-time job market insights.\n\nSCAA automates key stages of the job application process, including skill extraction, job role suggestions, resume improvement tips, salary research, and cover letter generation.\n\n📘 2. Project Objective\n\nMany job seekers struggle to understand:\n\nWhat skills their resume highlights\n\nWhich job roles match their profile\n\nHow to improve their resume\n\nWhat skills are in demand today\n\nCurrent salary trends\n\nThis project solves these problems with one intelligent agent that analyzes resumes and provides actionable insights within seconds.\n\n📘 3. What This Notebook Demonstrates (Capstone Requirements)\n\nThis notebook implements five ADK concepts (more than the minimum three required):\n\n✔ 1. LLM-powered agent using Gemini\n✔ 2. Built-in ADK Tool: google_search\n✔ 3. Custom Tool: Python skill extractor\n✔ 4. File processing: Automated PDF resume extraction\n✔ 5. Observability: run_debug() call with agent trace\n\nThese features combined form a full, real-world career assistant system.\n\n📘 4. System Workflow Overview\n\nLoad Resume (PDF) from Kaggle input\n\nExtract text using pdfplumber\n\nExtract skills using custom Python tool\n\nSend resume + skills to ADK agent\n\nAgent performs:\n\nResume summary\n\nJob role recommendations\n\nResume improvements\n\ngoogle_search tool call for job market trends\n\nCover letter generation\n\nThis creates a complete AI-driven career analysis pipeline.\n\n📘 5. Tools & Technologies Used\n\nGoogle ADK (Agent Development Kit)\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Lite\n\ngoogle_search Tool\n\nCustom Python Skill Extractor\n\nPDF text extraction using pdfplumber\n\nInMemoryRunner for debugging & agent flow\n\nKaggle Notebook environment\n\n📘 6. Key Features Implemented\n✔ Resume PDF Upload & Extraction\n\nThe system loads and processes a PDF file directly from the Kaggle dataset.\n\n✔ Skill Extraction Tool\n\nA custom Python tool extracts relevant technical skills from the resume text.\n\n✔ Intelligent Agent Reasoning\n\nThe ADK agent analyzes skills and provides smart recommendations.\n\n✔ Google Search Integration\n\nAgent fetches real-time market insights:\n\nSalary trends\n\nIn-demand skills\n\nJob descriptions\n\n✔ Cover Letter Generation\n\nThe agent creates a personalized, professional cover letter.\n\n📘 7. Results\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant produces:\n\nExtracted skills\n\nThree-point resume summary\n\nRecommended job roles\n\nResume improvement tips\n\nMarket skill demand\n\nSalary insights\n\nAuto-generated cover letter\n\nThese results significantly reduce the time required for job preparation.\n\n📘 8. Conclusion\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant (SCAA) demonstrates how a single ADK agent can combine local tools, LLM intelligence, and real-time search to build a practical, high-impact application. This project successfully automates career guidance and highlights the power of intelligent agents for real-world productivity.\n\n📘 9. Future Improvements\n\nAdd multi-agent system (Resume Agent + Salary Agent + Job Match Agent)\n\nIntroduce memory to personalize recommendations over time\n\nDeploy as a web application\n\nAdd PDF section detection (Education, Experience, etc.)\n\nJob–Resume Match Scoring","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries

Suitable Job Roles:**\n\n*   **Data Analyst:** This is a direct fit for John's experience and skills. His internship involved data cleaning, dashboard creation (Tableau, Power BI), and presenting insights, which are core responsibilities of a Data Analyst.\n*   **Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst:** The strong proficiency in Tableau and Power BI, coupled with experience in reporting and presenting insights, makes him a suitable candidate for a BI Analyst role. These roles focus on transforming data into actionable business intelligence.\n*   **Junior Data Scientist:** While his experience is primarily in data analysis, the mention of \"Machine Learning Basics\" and the strong Python skills could position him for entry-level Data Scientist roles, especially those with a focus on data preparation and initial analysis.\n\n**3. Resume Improvement Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Quantify Achievements:** Instead of stating \"Presented insights that improved decision-making processes,\" quantify the impact. For example, \"Presented data-driven insights that led to a 15% improvement in customer retention\" or \"Automated data cleaning workflows using Python and Pandas, reducing manual effort by 20 hours per week.\"\n*   **Elaborate on Projects/Responsibilities:** Briefly describe the types of business datasets analyzed and the nature of the insights presented. For instance, under \"Data Analyst Intern,\" expand on the dashboards: \"Built interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to visualize sales performance and customer trends.\"\n*   **Expand on \"Machine Learning Basics\":** If John has any specific projects or coursework related to machine learning, even basic ones, he should elaborate. This could include mentioning specific algorithms studied or a simple model built during his Master's program, even if not in a professional setting.\n\n**4. Skills in Demand for 2025:**\nJohn Doe's resume highlights skills that are highly in demand for 2025. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Python:** Consistently listed as a top programming language for data analysis and data science. Its versatility allows for data manipulation, automation, and machine learning implementation.\n*   **SQL:** Remains a fundamental and essential skill for data analysts and scientists, crucial for querying and managing databases. Over 80% of data analyst roles list SQL as a must-have skill.\n*   **Tableau and Power BI:** These data visualization tools are in high demand for creating interactive dashboards and reports, enabling stakeholders to understand complex data easily. They are key components of Business Intelligence.\n*   **Data Visualization and Storytelling:** The ability to translate complex data into clear visuals and narratives is critical for communicating insights and driving decisions.\n*   **Data Cleaning and Manipulation (Pandas):** Proficiency in cleaning and preparing datasets is essential and highly valued, as raw data often requires significant transformation before analysis.\n*   **Machine Learning Basics:** While John lists \"Machine Learning Basics,\" the broader field of machine learning and AI is experiencing significant growth and is a key trend in data science for 2025.
